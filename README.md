# Emory Dissertations Network
This is a Data Science project I made for my "QTM 340: Approaches to Data Science with Text" class. I used data from Emory Theses and Dissertations repository and textual analysis methods to computationally analyze collaboration between departments. Read my paper [here](Project_Paper.pdf)

I can't share my data since it is copyright-protected.

P.S.: I changed some document names and added directories after writing the code for better structure and comprehensibility. To replicate results, some document names might need to be adjusted when running the code.
