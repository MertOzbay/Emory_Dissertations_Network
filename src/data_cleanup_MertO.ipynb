      "Background: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is currently one of the most debilitating conditions in the world, affecting at least 20% of people at least once during their lifetimes. The pathophysiology of MDD is only beginning to be understood. Several studies have found inflammation be related to the clinical measures of depression severity and chronicity. Inflammation negatively impacts the white matter of the brain in several diseases of the central nervous system but whether inflammation-induced damage to white matter contributes to the pathophysiology of MDD has not been established.  Goal: This study investigated whether white matter integrity is related to measures of disease chronicity and severity. Further, inflammatory cytokines interleukin six‚Äôs and C-reactive Protein‚Äôs correlation with white matter integrity was examined. This study also explored whether gender modulates the inflammation effect.Methods: Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) and Tract Based Spatial Statistics were conducted on 125 treatment-na√Øve patients to create generalized linear models (GLM) exploring the relationship between severity, chronicity, white matter integrity as measured by four common DTI indices, and inflammation.Results: Results indicated significant negative correlations between white matter integrity and disease chronicity and severity, particularly in the corpus collosum, subgenual cingulate cortex (Brodmann Area 25), uncinate fasciculus, superior longitudinal fasciculus, and forceps minor. There were no significant correlations between IL6 or CRP and the DTI measures in the total sample set or male-female subgroups. Splitting the population into chronic and non-chronic patients revealed that in Brodmann Area 25 white matter integrity was decreased in chronic patients and increased in non-chronic patients.Conclusions: These results suggest that white matter pathology contributes to the pathophysiology of depression and is related to the severity and chronicity of illness. Although there were no significant relationships between IL6 or CRP and DTI indices in the total sample, the results suggest that inflammation-induced white matter pathology may contribute to the disease process in MDD patients with a chronic course of illness.\n",

      "Background: With increased chlorhexidine use in infection control practices, concerns of bacterial tolerance has grown. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are likely frequently exposed to chlorhexidine. Reduced chlorhexidine susceptibility in staphylococci is associated with quaternary ammonium compound (qac) efflux proteins. Mechanisms of tolerance to chlorhexidine beyond the qac proteins are also not well understood. Surveillance conducted by the Georgia EIP provided data to test patient factors contributing to increased chlorhexidine resistance. We serially exposed MRSA to increasing concentrations of chlorhexidine in a qac-negative MRSA strain to induce chlorhexidine tolerance.  Methods: 90 MRSA strains collected by the Georgia EIP were tested for MIC of chlorhexidine using standardized test provided by the CDC. Patient information was used to analyze whether any specific variable contributed to increased resistance. Additional laboratory experimentation, seeking to induce chlorhexidine tolerance, was completed. Using both liquid and plate cultures, colonies were selected and exposed to serial passaging in BHI broth with increasing concentrations (0.1 -10 ¬µg/mL) of chlorhexidine for 24-72 hours. After each passage to a higher concentration of chlorhexidine, colonies were examined and confirmed to be SA, tested by broth microdilution to confirm the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) to chlorhexidine and frozen.   Results: No significant relationships between any of the patient variables and chlorhexidine tolerance were identified. Notably, samples collected before and after widespread chlorhexidine usage did not show increased chlorhexidine tolerance. All in vitro experiments trying to induce chlorhexidine tolerance failed to produce a tolerant mutant. Discussion: Despite growing concerns about chlorhexidine tolerance in MRSA, this study does not show an increased chlorhexidine tolerance in MRSA despite widespread use in their respective healthcare facilities. In vitro evolution of increased tolerance to chlorhexidine susceptibility was not successful. These combined experiments suggest development of chlorhexidine resistance in MRSA is likely not as simple as previously assumed.\n",

      "Naive B cell (nB) differentiation to antibody-secreting plasma cells (ASC) requires significant transcriptional and epigenetic reprogramming events that are coupled to cell division. Following antigen stimulation, considerable heterogeneity exists between responding activated B cells (actB), such as their cell division capacity and ability to differentiate. However, a complete understanding of the factors that drive such heterogeneity are unknown. Here, we identified the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor-4 (IRF4) as one molecular determinant controlling cell fate outcomes.  Using an in vivo model system and single cell RNA-sequencing, we identified a bifurcation event that occurred during the earliest stages of B cell differentiation, with only one trajectory leading to ASC formation. This differentiation branch, termed the ASC-destined branch, required IRF4 induction and could be distinguished from non-ASC cells by loss of CD62L expression. Comparing bulk RNA-sequencing data from actB that followed each branch indicated the non-ASC cells contained a pre-memory B cell transcriptional signature, indicating they may be destined to become memory B cells. Additionally, these data indicated the IRF4-dependent ASC-destined branch upregulated gene sets necessary for proliferation. To explore the role of IRF4 on proliferation, we performed an adoptive transfer time course covering three days using IRF4-sufficent and -deficient B cells. We found that IRF4-deficient B cells divided but stalled during the proliferative response, indicating IRF4 also controlled the proliferative capacity of responding B cells. To better understand the cell division-coupled IRF4-dependent reprogramming events that occurred during the initial stages of B cell differentiation, CellTrace Violet (CTV)-labeled IRF4-sufficient and -deficient B cells were sorted in discrete divisions for RNA- and ATAC-sequencing. Transcriptional analyses revealed that IRF4 was critical for inducing MYC target genes and metabolic gene sets during the earliest cell divisions. Complementary chromatin accessibility analyses suggested a hierarchy of IRF4 binding activity and identified broad networks of dysregulated transcription factor families, including E-box binding family members. Indeed, IRF4-deficient B cells failed to induce Myc and displayed altered cell cycle distribution. Furthermore, IRF4-deficient B cells exhibited reduced mTORC1 signaling and were unable to increase in cell size. Myc overexpression in IRF4-deficient cells was able to rescue the cell growth defect, indicating an IRF4-MYC-mTORC1 relationship that controls cell growth and the proliferative capacity of actB in the earliest cell divisions. Taken together, we identify IRF4 as a key factor that instructs cell fate outcomes during the initial stages of B cell differentiation, including differentiation, proliferation, and cell growth.\n",

      "This project focuses on developing strategic pathways to pastoral succession within the Black Baptist Church and how a close reading of the Old Testament succession narrative of Moses and Joshua can help us gain insight into how a transition should be handled. Through this project the problem of poor succession planning was highlighted from the perspective of failure of churches to establish a succession plan that takes into account the health and wellness of both the outgoing and incoming pastors, as well as the church. The thesis for this project is that a pastoral succession plan that intentionally considers and seeks to support the health and wellness of pastors will ultimately lead to a healthier and thriving church on the other side of the leadership transition. The research highlights problems connected to successions and offers suggestions for strategies that may lead to better outcomes. It also highlights a suggested pathway that takes into account the health and wellness of both pastors and the congregation based on insights gleaned from the research process.\n",

      " BACKGROUND: Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a major birth of the diaphragm in which abdominal organs herniate into the thoracic cavity. CDH contributes substantially to infant mortality and disability. CDH has both genetic and environmental risk factors. Previous studies suggest maternal smoking and alcohol exposures during pregnancy may be associated with CDH, but more comprehensive studies are needed. Using data from the National Birth Defects Prevention Study, we examined associations between maternal early pregnancy (one month prior through three months following conception) smoking and alcohol exposures and CDH. METHODS: CDH cases and unaffected live born singleton controls, delivered from 1997 through 2011, were included. Interview reports of smoking (quantity, frequency, variability) and alcohol consumption (quantity, frequency, variability, type) were obtained from 883 case mothers and 11,829 control mothers. Two analyses were conducted: the main analysis examined deliveries from 2006-2011 and the second, a pooled analysis of all deliveries from 1997 through 2011. Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated for each smoking and alcohol exposure variable and all CDH and CDH subtypes using multivariable logistic regression analysis.  RESULTS: In the main analysis, positive associations were observed for any smoking, active and/or passive smoking, smoking a minimum of 15 cigarettes per day, and smoking for any duration during early pregnancy and all CDH. Findings were similar for CDH subtypes. Positive associations were also observed for drinking 30 or more drinks/month and 4 or more binge episodes and all CDH. Findings were generally similar for CDH subtypes, with additional positive association observed for 1 binge episode and drinking for 2 months during early pregnancy and CDH Bochdalek. The results of the pooled analyses were generally similar to those for 2006-2011.CONCLUSIONS: Several positive associations were observed between maternal smoking and all CDH and CDH subtypes. Whereas few positive associations were observed for maternal early pregnancy alcohol consumption and all CDH or CDH subtypes. Future studies should aim to improve exposure assessment and should examine potential mechanisms accounting for unexpected effects of maternal periconceptional cigarette smoking and alcohol observed in this study.  \n",

      "Airway inflammation in cystic fibrosis (CF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and severe asthma is marked by massive recruitment of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) from blood into the airway lumen. Therein, PMNs may assume a pathogenic role notably via the release of toxic granule mediators such as neutrophil elastase (NE). In CF, extracellular NE activity strongly correlates (negatively) with lung function. Despite this critical pathological importance, it remains unclear how and why NE and other granule mediators from PMNs are released into the lung lumen. In studies presented here, we describe for the first time the development of an in vitro model system that recapitulates the functional and metabolic changes that occur upon PMN recruitment to the CF lung. Using this model, we show that airway fluid from CF patients induces rapid transepithelial migration, primary granule release, increased glycolysis, and oxidant production by recruited PMNs. We also show that CF airway PMNs in vivo and in vitro increase intracellular caspase-1 activity, and surface expression of IL-1R1, both key elements of the inflammasome pathway. Moreover, we find that extracellular vesicles (EVs) from CF airway fluid are able to induce caspase-1 activation in na√Øve PMNs and airway epithelial cells. Conditioned PMNs also release resistin, an immunometabolic mediator which levels correlate strongly with lung disease in both children and adults with CF. Collectively, conditioning by CF airway fluid results in the development of the pathogenic ‚ÄúGRIM‚Äù PMN fate, featuring heightened primary granule release, immunoregulatory functions (arginase-1 and caspase-1 activation), and metabolic licensing. We identify GRIM PMNs in COPD and severe asthma (both in vivo and in our in vitro model) suggesting that this pathogenic fate is not restricted to CF. Finally, we show that the metabolic drug metformin modulates GRIM PMNs by decreasing their metabolic activity, granule release and oxidant production. Our work open new avenues for better understanding and targeting the process of pathogenic conditioning of PMNs as it occurs in chronic inflammatory airway diseases such as CF, COPD, and severe asthma. \n",

      "Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of pediatric morbidity and mortality worldwide. Appropriate case definitions are needed to accurately assess disease burden and evaluate novel RSV therapeutics and vaccines. Limited data exist on performance of RSV case definitions among young infants or in high-resource settings.\n",
      " \n",
      "Methods: We used data collected on infants <6 months of age tested for RSV as part of routine clinical care at Children‚Äôs Healthcare of Atlanta between January 2010-December 2015. We evaluated sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) of clinical features, existing case definitions used by the World Health Organization (WHO), and alternative definitions we constructed using latent class analyses (LCA) to detect laboratory-confirmed RSV infection.\n",
      " \n",
      "Results: Among 565 infants tested for RSV, 161 (28.5%) had laboratory-confirmed RSV infection. Among all case definitions evaluated, WHO-acute respiratory infection (ARI) (‚Äúcough or sore throat or shortness of breath or coryza, and a clinician‚Äôs judgment that illness is due to infection‚Äù) was the most sensitive [98.1%, 95% confidence interval (CI), 96.1‚Äì100.0, NPV 96.3%, 95% CI 92.2‚Äì100.0]. The definition developed through LCA (cough and shortness of breath and coryza and wheeze and poor feeding and chest in-drawing) was the most specific (95.8%, 95% CI 93.8‚Äì97.8; PPV 51.4%, 95% CI 34.9‚Äì68.0).\n",
      " \n",
      "Conclusions: The WHO ARI definition was the most sensitive for detecting laboratory-confirmed RSV infections among infants aged <6 months. However, alternative case definitions can confer higher specificity. Appropriate case definitions will vary depending on the context and setting in which they are utilized.    \n",

      "  Background: Rollins School of Public Health (RSPH) in 1990 created four concentrations under the Global Health Department including one on sexual and reproductive health and population. Sexual and reproductive health (SRH) has a broad definition that covers multiple subjects and keywords within the public health field.  The overall goals of this study were to explore where SRH, as measured by MPH theses, is located at RSPH , and to gather information that might aid in the development of SRH marketing and course offerings in the future. Methods: Data from Emory Universities Electronic Thesis (ETD) was used for the quantitative analysis on SRH theses at RSPH. Faculty and staff were a part of RSPH in the 1990‚Äôs when concentrations were established in the Global Health Department were approached for their evaluation of the educational program. All of the analysis for the theses were done through Google Sheets and WorldChart (World Map). Results: Graduate public health students at Emory, Rollins School of Public Health (RSPH) who enrolled between 2009-2018, and graduated between 2011-2020, produced 3242 MPH theses. Based on searches for keywords related to sexual and reproductive health, we found 1066 (32.9%) MPH theses were related to sexual and reproductive health topics. With a total of 112 key words (this link will take you to the list.) For example, IPV, Pregnancy, abortion, contraception, etc. According to the Electronic Thesis DataBases, approx. 33% of total theses from students enrolled from 2009-2018 have key words relating to SRH. Global Health Department students submitted 942 theses  from 2009-2018 (submitting their thesis in 2011-2020). Discussion: Results of this study provide the marketing team at RSPH details on the extensive sexual and reproductive health research and advising faculty at RSPH. If topical concentrations are removed, opportunity may exist for a natural quasi-experiment to determine its effect on topical theses.  \n",

This nitrone immediately cyclizes across the tethered p-bond providing unique azaoxabicyclo[2.2.1]heptanes with diastereospecificity. The N-O bond in these systems was readily cleaved under reductive conditions to furnish functionalizable 4-piperidone subunits. Depending on the nature of the starting oxime, 4-piperidone core structures were generated which allowed for the total syntheses of ()-cylindricine C, ()-7,8-epi-perhydrohistrionicotoxin, and ()-yohimbenone. Formal syntheses of ()-desamyl-perhydrohistrionicotoxin and ()-emetine were reached through this reaction manifold, as well as an approach to halichlorine. The method's tractability is underscored by its versatility, operational ease, and its ability to employ readily available oxime inputs. A previously unreported ring-oxidation mechanism involving N-alkyl-4-piperidones is also described, as well as a novel [4+2]-cycloaddition involving an oxofuran derivative.\n",

      "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer mortality in the United States.  Vitamin D may influence CRC development and progression in part via reducing inflammation, but the effect of supplemental vitamin D on inflammation in humans and whether certain individuals may particularly benefit from higher vitamin D for CRC prevention and prognosis is unclear.  In the first study, we tested the effects of supplemental vitamin D (1000 I.U./day) and/or calcium (1,200 mg/day) on two inflammation-related biomarkers of risk for CRC (COX-2 and 15-HPGD) in the rectal mucosa of 62 colorectal adenoma patients in a placebo-controlled chemoprevention trial.  We found that after one year of treatment the pro-inflammatory ratio of COX-2 /15-HPGD expression in full-length crypts statistically significantly decreased 47%more in the vitamin D group than in the placebo group (95% confidence interval [CI]: 36‚Äì76%) . In the second study, we investigated whether the association of circulating vitamin D (25[OH]D) with CRC risk differed by the missense GC-rs4588*A variant (Thr436Lys), encoding the vitamin D-binding protein-2 (DBP2) isoform, among 1,710 incident CRC cases and 1,649 matched controls nested within three prospective cohorts.  Multivariable-adjusted relative risks for CRC associated with 25(OH)D concentrations considered sufficient (‚â•50 nmol/L), relative to deficient (<30 nmol/L), were 0.47 (95% CI: 0.33‚Äì0.67) among individuals with DBP2, and 0.88 (95% CI: 0.61‚Äì1.27) among individuals without DBP2 (Pheterogeneity = 0.01).   In the third study, we investigated whether the association of pre-diagnostic 25(OH)D with mortality among CRC patients differed by the DBP2 isoform among 1,281 CRC cases (635 deaths, 483 from CRC) in two large prospective cohorts.  In the pooled analysis, multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios for CRC-specific mortality associated with deficient relative to sufficient 25(OH)D concentrations were 2.24 (95% CI: 1.44‚Äì3.49) among those with DBP2, and 0.94 (95% CI: 0.68‚Äì1.22) among those without DBP2 (Pinteraction = 0.0002).  The results of these studies indicate that vitamin D supplementation reduces CRC-promoting inflammation in the gut and that individuals with the inherited DBP2-encoding GC-rs4588*A missense variant‚Äîlinked to vitamin D insufficiency‚Äîmay particularly benefit from higher vitamin D exposure for CRC prevention and prognosis. \n",

      "Objective: Women are a key population affected by the HIV epidemic. Many women living with HIV are mothers who are faced with managing their healthcare and wellness needs along with those of their children and other family members. The purpose of this study is to explore challenges and facilitators to health and healthcare engagement for mothers living with HIV in the United States. Methods: This study was a secondary analysis of 76 qualitative interviews conducted with women who participated in the Women‚Äôs Adherence and Visit Engagement (WAVE) study, a sub-study embedded within The Women‚Äôs Interagency HIV Study (WIHS). The data excerpts used in this analysis were originally coded using the sub-codes motherhood, social support, and adherence/medication. Thematic analysis of the interview excerpts was conducted to identify sub-themes that emerged from the originally coded data. Results: Of the 76 women who participated in the study, the majority of the women identified as Black (N=46), and 52 women (68%) reported having 1 or more children. Commonly discussed facilitators of engagement in HIV care were: children as sources of strength and motivation, children as logistical support (appointment and medication reminders), and support from fellow mothers and parents living with HIV. The women discussed how children and HIV community support increased their healthcare utilization, improved medication adherence, and led to the prioritization of their health, not only for themselves but for the sake of their children. HIV-stigma and family-related stress and responsibilities emerged as challenges faced by the mothers participating in the study. Several participants reflected on the physical and emotional challenges of balancing motherhood responsibilities and an HIV diagnosis. Conclusion: These findings highlight the various ways in which motherhood and its complex and unique characteristics impact engagement in health and healthcare for women living with HIV. Future public health practice models and interventions should consider the intersectional nature of motherhood among women living with HIV, include parent-child support groups, and mandate HIV-stigma training for clinical providers, to better inform the development and improvement of comprehensive and appropriate interventions, programs, and clinical practice guidelines for mothers living with HIV.   \n",

      "In recent years, the water crisis in Israel/Palestine has been exacerbated by policies that restrict equal access to and distribution of water resources in the Occupied Territories and by natural conditions that result in rainfall deficiency and drought. Given the need to protect this precious commodity, this paper explores possibilities for transboundary water cooperation as a strategy of conflict transformation in the region. As a desire for justice, and care for both people and the land, is supported by the Judeo-Christian tradition, I suggest that shared religious convictions may ground environmental cooperation efforts between Israeli Jews and Palestinian Christians. Lastly, writing as an American Christian ethicist, and recognizing the contributions of third party agents to environmental cooperation and strategic peacebuilding, I argue that American Christians are called to participate in God‚Äôs vision for liberation by advocating on behalf of the oppressed in this conflict. \n",

      "BACKGROUND: Research has documented the effectiveness of pictorial health warning labels (HWLs) for reducing population level cigarette smoking, and may be particularly effective in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). Additional research is needed on LMICs disproportionately impacted by tobacco-related diseases and death to examine who may find different messages to aid in smoking prevention or cessation. Thus, we 1.) compared perceived effectiveness of pictorial vs. text-only HWLs; 2.) examined themes emerging from pictorial HWLs; and 3.) examined correlates of perceived effectiveness of different pictorial HWL themes among adults in the Republic of Georgia.METHODS: We analyzed a cross-sectional national household survey of Georgian adults conducted in 2014 (n=1,163). Participants were randomized to evaluate the perceived effectiveness (on a 9-point scale) of either Set A or Set B HWLs, with each set containing half of the HWLs presented pictorially and half with text-only. Bivariate analyses compared the perceived effectiveness of pictorial vs. text-only HWLs. We then conducted factor analyses to determine themes of pictorial HWLs, identifying gruesome and benign themes. Finally, regressions were conducted to identify sociodemographic and tobacco use related correlates of perceived effectiveness of the pictorial HWL themes.RESULTS: Factor analyses identified one factor among Set A HWLs, labeled ‚Äúbenign‚Äù; Set B yielded two factors ‚Äì ‚Äúbenign‚Äù and ‚Äúgruesome.‚Äù All gruesome HWLs were perceived as more effective than text only; however, 2 of the 9 benign HWLs were perceived as no more effective than text only. Among Set A HWLs, correlates of greater perceived effectiveness for all participants included: being female (p<.001), living in a rural setting (p=.001), not having children in the home (p=.038), and being a nonsmoker (p=.005); for non-smokers, being female (p=.016), and living in a rural setting (p=.017); and for current smokers, being female (p=.014), not married/living with a partner (p=.045), having more close friends who smoke (p=.013), and rating quitting smoking as more important (p=.009). Among Set B HWLs, 43.8% rated gruesome HWLs more effective, 43.4% rated gruesome and benign equally effective, and 12.9% rated benign more effective. Correlates of benign HWL effectiveness included having fewer friends who smoked (p=.019), and a higher household income (p=.031); and for smokers, fewer friends who smoked (p=.013) and perceiving quitting smoking to be important (p=.006). Finally, a lower household income (p=.003) predicted gruesome HWLs effectiveness.  CONCLUSIONS: While pictorial HWLs are largely perceived as more effective, gruesome and only some benign HWLs outperform text-only. Some benign HWLs are perceived as equally effective, and a minority found them more effective than gruesome HWLs. Some benign HWLs may be more effective for smokers rating quitting as important. Social factors are critical in understanding the effectiveness and impact of pictorial HWLs.  \n",

      "\tPrevious epidemiologic studies have found that racial disparities in breast cancer-specific mortality are partially attributed to increased surgical delays for black women compared to white women, even after controlling for insurance coverage and access to care. Previous studies have also found that racial disparities in breast cancer outcomes may be partially attributed to the facility in which women receive treatment.No previous studies have investigated whether the racial disparities in treatment delays and mortality are associated with facility-level characteristics. The current study investigates which facility characteristics are associated with increased racial disparities in surgical delays for breast cancer treatment and in breast cancer-specific mortality. Logistic regression was used to model facility characteristics and treatment delay. Cox proportional hazard regression was used to model facility characteristics and mortality. Interactions by patient race was assessed for both associations. The final sample included 3,857 white and 2,341 black women from 35 Metro Atlanta surgical facilities. The median surgical delay was higher in black women (36.0; SD=50.69) compared to white women (29.0; SD=26.50). The largest disparities in delay between white and black women were among patients with Medicare, patients treated in low or moderate volume facilities, government facilities, or facilities with an ACOSOG affiliation. Facilities without a medical school affiliation had lower odds of surgical delay for white patients (aOR=0.89, 95% CI: 0.71, 1.11), but higher odds among black patients (aOR=1.11, 95% CI: 0.92, 1.34). Government (aOR=0.72, 95% CI: 0.66, 0.79) and for-profit hospitals (aOR=0.72, 95% CI: 0.81, 0.89) had lower odds of surgical delay compared to non-profit hospitals. High facility volume was inversely associated with mortality among white patients (aHR=0.60, 95% CI: 0.44, 0.83), yet positively associated among black patients (aHR=1.32, 95% CI: 0.85, 2.05). COC-accreditation was inversely associated with mortality among white patients (aHR=0.69, 95% CI: 0.38, 1.17), yet positively associated among black patients (aHR=1.18, 95% CI: 0.74, 1.88). Future studies with larger samples of patients, which can obtain surgical delay and breast cancer-specific mortality should continue to investigate the associations between various facility characteristics and patient outcomes. \n",

      "The critical role of T cells in tumor surveillance and eradication in a variety of cancers has been established by recent advances in the understanding of T cell-tumor interactions. These advances have led to the development of a wide array of immunotherapeutic strategies that have seen varying degrees of clinical success. The use of T cell-based immunotherapies has largely been explored in settings of solid tumors whose high mutational burden provide a large amount of neo-antigenic targets. Unlike solid tumors, hematological malignancies such as leukemia and lymphoma have a relatively low mutational burden that severely limits their potential to be recognized and eliminated by autologous T cells. In addition to problems with tumor cell recognition, T cell responses to both solid and hematological malignancies are also inhibited by active and passive immune evasion strategies. While T cell responses to solid tumors largely fail as a result of exhaustion and inhibitory signals in the tumor microenvironment, endogenous antigen-specific T cells recognizing leukemia and lymphoma cells may be limited by the failure of antigen-specific T cells to fully activate in vivo leading to their subsequent deletion. This failure of primary T cell activation is attributed to the disseminated nature of hematological malignancies that results in decreased antigen and danger signal densities. Thus, the failure of T cells to eliminate solid tumors is an issue of exhaustion while the failure to eliminate leukemia and lymphoma cells is an issue of immunological ignorance or anergy. Despite these fundamental differences, similar strategies to enhance the anti-tumor T cell response have been explored in both disease settings. Hematological malignancies served as the prototypical target of immunotherapies with the advent of stem cell transplants and monoclonal antibodies. While these therapies remain powerful tools for the treatments of these diseases, many emerging therapies focus on enhancing autologous T cell responses. Some of these treatments include checkpoint blockade, cytokine therapies, and therapeutic and prophylactic vaccinations. The results of immunotherapies designed to bolster autologous anti-tumor T cell responses have been less promising in hematological malignancies due in large part to the reduced immunogenicity of the malignant cells which renders T cells anergic or senescent. In spite of this large obstacle, T cell-based therapies hold tremendous promise for leukemia and lymphoma treatment, and as such, it is critical to explore additional avenues for strengthening the anti-tumor response in these settings.We addressed the issues of T cell anergy and senescence in settings of leukemia and lymphoma by using antagonists to the vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and PI3K Œ¥ pathways to improve T cell activation and reverse or prevent senescence in settings of murine model systems of leukemia and lymphoma and pre-clinical studies of T cell expansion and CAR T cell manufacturing using clinical samples obtained from lymphoma patients. Using a peptide VIP antagonist, VIPhyb, as a therapeutic in leukemic mice we found that small subcutaneous doses led to a significant reduction in tumor burden and a significant survival benefit. The effect of VIPhyb was T cell-mediated as VIPhyb-treated mice had increased frequencies of effector CD8 T cells with reduced expression of PD-1 at later time points during tumor development, and the anti-tumor promoting activity of VIPhyb required the presence of CD8+ T cells in treated mice. Furthermore, T cells from VIPhyb-treated mice conferred protection from acute myeloid leukemia challenge following adoptive transfer to Rag1 knockout recipients. Based on these results, we explored the use of VIPhyb in combination with the PI3K Œ¥ inhibitor Idelalisib in the setting of ex vivo anti-CD3/CD28-mediated T cell expansion for chimeric antigen receptor T cell manufacture. Expansion of T cells from heavily treated DLBCL patients in the presence of VIPhyb and Idelalisib resulted in significantly increased yields as well as a preservation of the na√Øve and central memory compartments. T cells expanded in the presence of Idelalisib and VIPhyb had the greatest in vivo persistence in murine xenografts and significantly enhanced antigen-specific cytotoxic activity in an OVA-expressing murine tumor model. The results of our murine and human studies highlight the role of the VIP and PI3K Œ¥ pathways in T cell dysfunction in settings of leukemia and lymphoma. The addition of these inhibitors to clinical expansion cultures of T cells for adoptive cell therapies may provide a much-needed tool that is currently missing in immunotherapeutic strategies for the treatment and management of hematological malignancies.\n",

      "Malassezia furfur is a commensal lipophilic fungus found on the surface of the skin that is implicated in the pathogenesis of several prevalent skin conditions, including Atopic Dermatitis (AD), Seborrheic Dermatitis (SD), and Tinea Versicolor (TV). With antifungal resistance becoming an increasing concern, it is important to identify new therapeutic options. While several studies have demonstrated anti-Malassezia activity with botanical extracts, the concentration tested is often high (>500 Œºg/mL) and not evaluated for mammalian cytotoxicity. \n",
      "The purpose of this study was to screen for potential anti-Malassezia activity of botanical extracts using a unique chemical library, the Quave Natural Products Library (QNPL), based on plants used in the traditional treatment of infectious and inflammatory skin disease. Initial screen of the QNPL (~1000 extracts) was conducted at 16 Œºg/mL, but failed to demonstrate anti- Malassezia activity. A second screen of the library was conducted at 128 Œºg/mL by broth microtiter plate dilution method in triplicate. \n",
      "The screen revealed potential activity for crude extracts 31, 55, 66, 637, and 1251 and pure compounds 448, 449, and 451. Further analysis via two-fold serial dilution in quadruplicate demonstrated 48-hour MIC90 at 128 Œºg/mL for extract 1251, Allium amethystinum, and 16 Œºg/mL for pure compound 451 as compared to 2 Œºg/mL for Ketoconazole control. Minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) was determined by agar plate test. MFC was 256 Œºg/mL for both pure compound 451 and extract 1251. We also conducted two-fold serial dilution on extracts 158 and 237, ethanolic and methanolic crude extracts of Allium cepa (onion) in the same genus as A. amethystinum, but failed to observe any growth inhibition at either 24 or 48-hour optical density reads. \n",
      "To our knowledge, this is the first report of antifungal activity of Allium amethystinum. Mammalian cytotoxicity as determined by testing of human keratinocytes (HaCaTs) via LDH assay revealed that extract 1251 did not achieve an IC50 in HaCaTs at 512 Œºg/mL, twice the concentration that exhibited fungicidal activity. This provides promising evidence for potential topical treatments that include Allium amethystinum. \n",
      "Chemical inhibition of Malassezia furfur at lesional skin sites could support reduced allergenic responses and inflammation, improving symptoms of disease and decreasing risk of fungal resistance from current topical treatments. Future efforts to isolate the active compound(s) of extract 1251 via iterative bioassay guided fractionation are warranted. \n",

      "Background: Diarrhoeal diseases remain an important cause of mortality and morbidity among children, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Diarrheal disease leads to around 525,000 deaths in the children under the age of five and is the second leading cause of under-five childhood deaths. Water quality is an important determinant of diarrheal disease but is captured in only a limited number of large routine population-based surveys. The aim of this study was to assess the association between E.coli counts in drinking water and the occurrence of diarrhea among children aged 0-5 years.  Methods:  Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), a cross-sectional household survey, was conducted in Bangladesh, Nepal, Republic of Congo and Paraguay. The survey included an indicator for diarrhoea episodes in the two weeks preceding the survey, as recalled by the primary caregiver, and E.coli counts in drinking water. The sample size was 3609 children, yielding information on sociodemographic, environmental and hygiene related behavioural factors of the household. Mixed univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses was used to identify the risk factors associated with the occurrence of diarrhoea in children under-five.Results: The reported prevalence of diarrhoea among children under the age of five during the 2 weeks preceding the survey was 12%. Univariable and the multivariable analysis showed there to be no association between the incidence of diarrhea and the E.coli counts in the drinking water. Multivariable regression revealed an association between the incidence of diarrhea in children under-five and the source of drinking water, wealth index of the household and age (in years) of the child.Conclusion: The results of this study reveal that there is no association between E.coli-based water quality measures on the day of the survey and the outcome of diarrhea. This may be because both exposure and outcome are imprecise; paternal recall is associated with bias and E.coli counts may not be a good predictor of the full extent of pathogen exposure in the drinking water or the overall environmental exposure. \n",

      "BACKGROUND: Antidepressant medications (AD‚Äôs) are associated with autonomic dysfunction which is linked with future risk of (CVD) cardiovascular disease. However, it is not clear if certain AD‚Äôs types are associated with more CVD than others. We hypothesized that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) are associated with reduced hazards of Atrial Fibrillation (AF), Heart Failure (HF), Myocardial Infarction (MI) and Ischemic Stroke (IS) as compared to other AD medications (non-SSRI). METHODS AND RESULTS:  We studied 2027 participants from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study (mean age 63 ¬± 10 years; 29% men; 78% white) who self-reported AD use during one of the ARIC five visits (1987 through 2013). Exposure to SSRI vs non-SSRI was determined. Participants were followed up to 2016 for a median of 13.5 years.  A total of 329, 366, 198 and 1345 events for AF, HF, MI and IS, respectively, were identified in this ARIC subset. Using multivariable Cox regression models to adjust for sociodemographic and clinical risk factors, SSRI was not significantly associated with hazards of AF, HF, MI and IS, when compared to non-SSRI medications [hazard ratio (HR)= 1.11, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) (0.8-8 1.40), HR= 0.93, 95%CI 0.72- 1.20, HR= 0.91, 95%CI, 0.65-1.27 HR= 1.02, 95%CI, (0.67-1.56), respectively.]CONCLUSION: In a community-based sample of individuals initiating AD‚Äôs, type of AD was not associated with statistically different hazards of CVD outcomes including AF, HF, MI and IS. These results do not provide evidence supporting the use of a particular AD over another in relation to CVD risk.\n",

      "BackgroundAfrican American women are affected by earlier onset of age-associated health deteriorations and obesity disproportionally, but little is known about the mechanism linking body mass index (BMI) and biological aging among this population. DNA methylation age acceleration (DNAm AA), measuring the difference between DNA methylation age and chronological age, is a novel biomarker of biological aging process, and predict aging-related disease outcomes. MethodsThe present study estimated cross-tissue DNA methylation age acceleration using saliva samples from 232 young African American women. Cross-sectional regression analyses were performed to assess the association of body mass index with age acceleration.Results The average chronological age and DNA methylation age were 31.67 years, and 28.79 years, respectively. After adjusting for smoking, hypertension diagnosis history, and socioeconomic factors (education, marital status, household income), 1 kg/m2 increase in BMI is associated with 0.14 years increment of DNAm AA (95% CI: (0.08, 0.21)).ConclusionIn African American women, high BMI is associated with saliva-based DNA methylation age acceleration, after adjusting for smoking, hypertension, and socioeconomic status. This finding demonstrated the positive association between BMI and DNAm AA across tissue types and demographic groups, and supports the hypothesis that high BMI and obesity accelerate biological aging.\n",

      "Context: Among rural Kenyan children, only 30% meet global indicators for minimumdietary diversity. For infants and young children 6-24 months old, diet diversity is anindicator of nutritional adequacy and is inversely associated with malnutrition andstunting. The International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) is a non-profit organizationthat works in rural communities in Kenya to improve child nutrition through dairyprograms. To inform their programming, ILRI conducted formative research amongmothers, fathers, and grandmothers of infants and young children to understand theperceived barriers and facilitators of diet diversity and milk feeding practices. Thisstudy‚Äôs objectives are to identify the key determinants of behavior that drive diet diversityand milk consumption behaviors in rural communities in Kenya. Methods: Data were collected in 2017 in Busia, Kitui, Siaya, Taita Taveta, and Vihigacounties. A barrier analysis survey was conducted among 100 mothers of infants andyoung children 6-24 months old and 15 focus groups were conducted among mothers,fathers, and grandmothers. Survey participants were categorized as ‚Äúdoers‚Äù or ‚Äúnondoers‚Äùof two desired behaviors of diet diversity and milk consumption and analyzed with chisquaretests. Focus group discussion data were used to triangulate findings from thesurveys. Results: 41% of all mothers had fed their child from at least four food groups in theprevious day and 66% of mothers of children 12-24 months fed their child at least oneserving of milk per day (doer status). Significant differences between doers and nondoersfor the diet diversity analysis included action-efficacy and perceived advantages. Milkserving doers tended to have more self-efficacy compared to nondoers and cited livestockownership more often as a facilitator. Discussion: To successfully change behavior, ILRI‚Äôs programming should focus onimproving mothers‚Äô knowledge of how diet diversity can prevent malnutrition in infantsand young children. Milk‚Äôs acceptability for children in the community was confirmed butthere were differences in perceptions of access. Household livestock ownership and milkproduction may play an important role in improving mothers‚Äô opportunity to feed theirchildren more milk. Further analyses should examine doer and nondoer behavior byregion.\n",

      "Objectives: Type II endometrial cancers (serous, clear cell and carcinosarcoma) only account for approximately 10% of cancers, but they are responsible for a significant proportion of the morbidity and mortality. The goal of this study was to compare survival and perioperative outcomes in women with type II endometrial cancers who underwent staging via laparotomy (XL) vs. minimally invasive approach (MIS). \n",
      "Methods: All patients who underwent surgery for Type II endometrial cancer at two academic cancer centers in Detroit,  Michigan  between January 2005 and December 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy or radiation, and those with endometrioid histology were excluded. Clinical, demographic characteristics, surgical outcomes were examined using univariate and multivariable analysis.  Survival analysis was calculated using Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox proportional hazards regression.\n",
      "Results: A total of 249 patients were included, 193 underwent laparotomy, and 58 MIS, including conventional laparoscopic or robotic surgery. The majority had stage I disease (IA, 104 [41.3%] and IB, 20[7.9%]). Stages II, III, and IV were identified in 18 (7.1%), 79 (31.6%), and 31 (12.4%) respectively. Multivariate analysis demonstrated being African American (OR 0.29; 95%CI 0.14 - 0.61), having mixed histology(OR 0.29; 95% CI 0.16 - 0.98), and stage III-IV disease (OR 0.46; 95%CI 0.21-0.97) were inversely associated with undergoing MIS. MIS was associated with ability to complete staging. Higher perioperative transfusions, EBL >250 cc and longer hospital stay were also associated with laparotomy. Higher lymph node yield was associated with MIS compared to laparotomy. Recurrence rate was 38 % for the laparotomy group and 19% for MIS. There was no difference in 3 year-PFS after controlling for age, race, procedure, histology, stage and adjuvant therapy. There was no difference in overall survival between laparotomy and MIS for type II endometrial cancers in this series. \n",

      "Objective: Healthcare providers experience high rates of burnout. Provider burnout includes feelings of emotional exhaustion and ineffectiveness associated with prolonged exposure to patients‚Äô suffering. Hospital chaplains are relied on to provide spiritual, social, and emotional support to acutely distressed patients, and may be particularly susceptible to burnout. The purpose of the current study is to examine the effectiveness of incorporating compassion meditation training into a clinical pastoral education (CPE) curriculum to reduce burnout and negative emotional symptomology among hospital chaplain residents.                                                                   Methods: A longitudinal, quasi-experimental design was used to examine the impact of Cognitively-Based Compassion Training (CBCT¬Æ), a group-delivered compassion meditation intervention in reducing adverse mental health outcomes, including burnout. Hospital chaplain residents (n = 15) were assigned to participate in a CBCT intervention in the fall of their CPE program or a waitlist comparison group that received CBCT in the spring of their CPE program. We assessed depression, anxiety, stress, burnout, secondary trauma stress, and compassion satisfaction at four-time points: baseline, immediately after the intervention group received CBCT, 4-month follow-up before the waitlist group received CBCT, and after the waitlist group received CBCT.Results: Compared to the waitlist comparison group, chaplains assigned to CBCT reported significant decreases in burnout and anxiety; though, the effect was not maintained at 4-month follow-up. Other outcomes did not differ significantly post-intervention but were trending in the expected direction. Secondary analyses that collapsed the intervention and waitlist group into a single group pre-post design indicated that CBCT training was associated with significant decreases in depression, anxiety, burnout, and secondary trauma stress, and increases in compassion satisfaction. Conclusions: Findings support the hypothesis that group-delivered compassion meditation training incorporated into CPE is effective for reducing burnout and anxiety among hospital chaplain residents, although it may be necessary to continue CBCT throughout residency to sustain effects. \n",

      "Background: Heart failure (HF) is common and characterized by a high rate of mortality. Seniors (people 65 years and older) make up a significant proportion of the total HF population but are not well represented in many clinical trials. We aim to assess predictors of mortality among seniors acutely re-hospitalized for decompensated HF. Methods: A single-site prospective study of seniors with HF readmitted within 30 days of discharge for HF over a six-month period (January 1, 2020, to June 10, 2020). Following the review of electronic medical records, demographic, and laboratory parameters at the time of hospitalization were extracted. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to assess predictors of mortality. Statistical significance was defined as a p-value of < 0.05 and a confidence interval of 95%. Results: Our study included 452 patients. The age range of the cohort was 65 to 101 years (mean 78.73 ¬± 8.48 years). Of this, 206(46%) were males, 28% were 85 years or older. The median follow-up time was 84 days, and the observed short-term mortality was 22%. After univariate analysis, the hazards for death among seniors with HF significantly decreased by 5% for each unit increase in serum sodium. Following multivariate analysis, nonblacks who were not discharged home after the index hospitalization had lower hazards of death than blacks not discharged home at the index admission (adjusted hazards ratio (aHR) 0.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.16, 0.67). Patients with the lowest tertile range for systolic blood pressure (SBP) had twice the hazard for death compared to patients with the highest tertile for SBP. Patients with access to primary care provider (PCP) had 5 times the hazards of death compared to patients without access to a PCP. Conclusion: Seniors who are acutely re-hospitalized for decompensated HF have a very high short term mortality rate. Hyponatremia and low systolic blood pressure are independent predictors of mortality. Black seniors who were not discharged home after their index hospitalization for HF had higher hazards for all-cause mortality compared to nonblacks.  \n",

      "T cells are key players in adaptive immune system, and their activation is crucial for maintaining functional defense mechanisms that destroy infected or cancer cells. Productive T cell activation only occurs when T cells form physical contact with opposing cells that present cognate antigens on their surfaces. This initial antigen recognition by T cell receptor triggers a series of phosphorylation events that ultimately activates T cell signaling and functions. Recent work has demonstrated externally applied forces can activate T cells. However, whether T cells generate internal forces transmitted to the surface receptors and whether these forces have a role in regulating T cell signaling and functions remain unexplored.This thesis presents two separate lines of studies pertaining to development of biophysical tools that harness mechanical properties of DNA to study cell mechanics. In the first part of this thesis, I developed and applied DNA-based force probes that report (or physically cap) forces generated by the surface receptors of T cells with high spatial, temporal and force resolution. Work presented in Chapter 2 revealed that T cell receptor transmits pN forces to its antigen at artificial cell-cell junctions, using hybrid supported lipid bilayer as a model cell surface. Importantly, these forces persist when T cell receptor-antigen complexes spatially reorganize at the junction. In Chapter 3, I showed that T cell‚Äôs LFA-1 adhesion receptor is a mechanosensor, where lateral mobility of cognate ICAM-1 ligand controls T cell-substrate interaction. I demonstrated LFA-1 can transmit forces >19 pN upon cell adhesion and migration, with a distinct force pattern compared to T cell receptor forces. Lastly, I discovered that LFA-1 mechanically communicates with T cell receptor to achieve fine-tuned T cell spreading, early signaling and functional responses. In the second part of this thesis (Chapter 4), I developed the first catalytic amplification assay for readout of integrin forces generated by fibroblasts. Additionally, I examined its potential in screening drugs that impair cell mechanics in a high throughput format. Overall, this thesis showcases the potential uses of engineered DNA structures as novel biophysical tools to revolutionize cellular force measurement.\n",

      "Introduction: Drought can cause widespread and complex regional impacts and numerous pathways have been hypothesized connecting drought to health effects. One area of drought research that is lacking is the effects of drought on all-cause mortality, especially in higher income countries such as the United States. This study aims to evaluate the associations between droughts and same-year all-cause mortality in adults in the United States from 1968-2014 in order to better understand the health impacts of drought.\n",
      "Methods: Drought exposure was classified using an annual drought severity score for each county derived from a dataset of 1-month, county-level Standardized Precipitation and Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI). An analogous score for abnormally wet years was also derived. All-cause mortality data came from a dataset from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention‚Äôs (CDC) mortality counts, censored on counts 1-9 across narrow demographic strata. We modeled county-stratum-year mortality using interval-censored [1,9] negative binomial regression with random intercepts by each combined age-race-sex stratum with and without further stratification by National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Association climate regions, and with and without inclusion of years classified as abnormally wet. False discovery-rate adjusted-p values were obtained to correct for multiple testing. Random effects meta-regressions were completed to test the associations between the predictors with the drought-mortality regression coefficient. Meta-analyses were then completed to obtain a pooled IRR and I2 as a measure of between-study heterogeneity.\n",
      "Results: Most of the results were null for the association of drought severity and mortality, across categories of race, age, sex and region for all analyses. A small number of IRRs were significant after accounting for the multiple testing for certain subgroups, but without clear patterns by age, race, sex or region. The meta-analyses resulted in a pooled IRR of 0.999 (0.999, 1.000) from the analyses that stratified by NOAA region, with and without wet county-years included. The I2 of approximately 50% for both analyses suggests that about half of the total variation across stratified groups is due to heterogeneity.\n",
      "Discussion: These results suggest that, for the majority of demographic subgroups and across climate regions, there is no significant effect of drought intensity on mortality rates within the same year in the contiguous United States over 1968-2014. The handful of significant results that remained after accounting for multiple testing suggest a possible health effect for certain subgroups, but this heterogeneity was not consistent across broad patterns of age, race, sex or region. The findings could indicate contextual heterogeneity in the effects of drought on mortality, and either true null associations for most subgroups, or limitations in study design for observing the effects.  \n",

      "Enteric disease¬≠ ‚Äî including diarrheal illness and soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections ¬≠‚Äî is common in low-resource settings and primarily driven by inadequate access to water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH). To better understand the potential for environmental improvements to mitigate enteric infection, we designed and conducted a series of studies in rural Lao People‚Äôs Democratic Republic to measure the prevalence of enteropathogens, elucidate how enteropathogens interact with each other, and quantify the role of WASH in schools as a potential environmental mediator of infection in school children.    We conducted a longitudinal cluster-randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the impact of a comprehensive WASH in schools (WinS) evaluation on pupil absence and health among 100 randomly selected primary schools (50 intervention and 50 control). Within this study, we conducted a cross-sectional sub-study to examine the underlying drivers of enteropathogen infections and co-infection among households in the RCT school-hosting communities. We utilized a household survey to measure demographics and WASH access, and collected stool samples from three household members (child <5, school-aged child, and their parent). Stool samples (n=891) were analyzed for 25 enteropathogens using a quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay. Enteropathogen infection was nearly universal; 98.3% of participants had at least one infection (mean=4.3 infections, standard deviation=2.0). Associations between household- and village-level WASH transmission pathways and infection were heterogenous across taxa and specific pathogens. STH infection was associated with lower odds of concurrent viral infections (odds ratio [OR]: 0.48, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.28, 0.83), but higher odds of concurrent bacterial infections (OR: 1.81, 95% CI: 1.06, 3.07) and concurrent protozoal infections (OR: 1.50, 95% CI: 0.95, 2.37). In the parent trial, we found no impact of the WinS intervention on any primary (pupil absence) or secondary (enrollment, dropout, grade progression, diarrhea, respiratory infection, conjunctivitis, STH) impacts. Results highlight the challenges and complexities of mitigating enteric disease due to a diverse range of pathogens, multiple transmission routes, within-host interactions, and human-environment interactions.  \n",

      "Aim: Conducted an epigenome-wide association study to identify novel HbA1c-associated CpG sites in whole blood DNA.Patients & methods: We performed an epigenome-wide association study of hyperglycemia among 258 non-diabetic male twins using linear mixed effect models. DNA Methylation at each cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites as a function of HbA1c, adjusting for age, smoking, BMI and calculated proportion of peripheral blood leukocytes subtypes.Results: Regression analysis showed that identified three CpG sites significantly associated with HbA1c according to within-twin effect after multiple testing correction (FDR less than 0.05), including cg00725722 (CCDC74B, p-value = 2.74 √ó 10-7), cg19142411(RAD52, p-value = 9.54√ó 10-8), cg00773483 (RNF150; p-value = 2.04 √ó 10-7). We also identified 25 CpG sites significantly associated (FDR<0.05) with HbA1C via between-twin effect (unshared association between co-twins).Conclusion: This epigenome-wide study discovered significant association (FDR <0.05) between HbA1c and DNA methylation level in within-twin and between-twin effects. There were no DNA methylation sites significantly associated with HbA1C in both between-twin effect and within-twin effect after multiple testing correction, which suggested that for different HbA1C-associated DNA methylation sites, the epigenetic associations were mostly driven by either shared or unshared factors, but not both.\n",

      "Background: As of 2018, there are still millions of individuals who are vitamin A deficient worldwide, which causes adverse health outcomes such as ocular manifestations and impaired immune system function. While it is known that inflammation has an impact on measurements of vitamin A biomarkers, there is no standardized approach to adjust assessments for inflammation.Goal: The goal of this research was to evaluate the impact of inflammation caused by norovirus infection on vitamin A biomarkers, retinol and retinol binding protein.Methods: Using longitudinal data collected from 52 individuals in two separate norovirus challenge studies, we assessed the molar relationship between retinol and retinol binding protein, compared the methodology and utility in the Thurnham and Biomarkers Reflecting Inflammation and Nutritional Determinants of Anemia (BRINDA) inflammation-adjustment approaches on longitudinal data, and assessed the kinetics of serum retinol over the course of an infection using linear-mixed methods.Results: The average ratio between retinol and RBP was 0.69 (IQR=0.12), which violates popular assumptions but corroborates findings from other studies. While both the BRINDA and Thurnham-adjustment approaches were appropriate using longitudinal data, the mild inflammatory response resulted in 0 or 1 individual in the early convalescence or late period in 7 of the time points. Thus, we were unable to compare the results of the Thurnham correction factor approach. Although the BRINDA-adjustment initially was successful in correcting retinol towards baseline on days 2, 3, and 4 post-exposure, retinol was significantly different (1.02-1.12 ¬µmol/L) from baseline on days 4 (p=0.03), 7 (p<0.001), 14 (p<0.001), and 35 (p=0.01). Lastly, we were able to demonstrate a 0.01 ¬µmol/L reduction in retinol as a result of inflammation by day post-exposure (p=0.03).Conclusions: The results of this study demonstrate (1) the presumed molar 1:1 ratio is not upheld even in healthy populations subjected to a norovirus challenge, (2) the BRINDA approach was more appropriate than Thurnham in the face of low-levels of inflammation, and (3) modeling indicated an overall effect of inflammation by day post-exposure on changes in retinol concentration.Public Health Implications: Because we found that the ratio between retinol and RBP was not equimolar, future assessments that use RBP as a proxy to measure vitamin A levels should consider adjusting the cutoff values for VAD. While both correction methods are appropriate for longitudinal analysis, adjustment for inflammation in populations with low-levels of inflammation should be conducted using the BRINDA approach. Finally, we demonstrated that consideration for inflammation is needed even in populations with low-levels of inflammation as it can still alter serum retinol levels.\n",

      "Kidney obstruction is a serious condition where the body‚Äôs urinary system develops resistance to urine outflow. Radionuclide renal imaging plays a major role in evaluating a kidney with suspected obstruction. Current practices model 99mTc-mercaptoacetyltriglycine (MAG3) gamma tracer concentration across time through a renogram curve to help in the diagnosis of kidney obstruction. One important issue that exists in interpreting kidney obstruction is that there are high misclassification rates of whether a kidney is obstructed or not because of the lack of training in diuretic renography among radiologists. The objective of this work is to provide another perspective on the statistical and computer-assisted diagnosis for kidney obstruction by assessing functional data clustering methods in the classification of renogram curves. We considered seven existing algorithms with the training dataset (N=147) where 23.80% of the renogram curves were from obstructed kidneys. We first use the training dataset to evaluate the unsupervised clustering algorithms against the consensus on kidney obstruction from three experts. We then evaluate the accuracy of prediction by using another dataset where we predict the obstruction status for each kidney from clustering methods developed with the training data. We also assess the performance of the best performing clustering methods in a group of kidneys which are difficult to interpret. The clustering algorithms of fscm, waveclust, and itersubspace provide reasonable results for the training set with a kappa of 0.7917, 0.7322, and 0.522 respectively. These three methods resulted with a sensitivity of 82.86%, 77.14%, and 91.43% and specificity of 95.54%, 94.64%, and 74.11% in the training set respectively. With the validation set, we find that only the two algorithms of fscm and waveclust perform strongly with a kappa of 0.7273 and 0.6957, sensitivity of 75.00% and 100.00%, and specificity of 95.00% and 80.00% respectively. With the difficult renogram curves, we saw that fscm and waveclust gave ratings most similar to expert one while often not aligning with the majority expert rating. These two algorithms have shown potential to separate obstructed and unobstructed kidneys. Studies with larger sample sizes may provide further insight to the success of these algorithms in assisting kidney interpretations.\n",

As such, there have been multiple attempts to equate the two tests, usually using equipercentile weighting. This method does not adequately control for confounding variables such as race, education, and age.  Therefore, we used regression methods to control for these potential confounding variables.\n",
      " \n",
      "Methods: We used a set of quantile regression models to evaluate potential nonlinear effects between each of the tests and our three variables of interest: age, education, and race. If there was no nonlinear effect present, then we used parametric methods to equate MoCA and MMSE. First, we proposed a linear model with splines to control for potential ceiling effects in the MMSE. This model does not restrict the predictions to be within scientific boundaries. If there were a large number of scientifically absurd predictions we used a non-linear link function. \n",

      "Results: There were 927 subjects, split into training (n=648) and validation (n=279) datasets. Our population was largely white and highly educated. The quantile regression showed different effects at the tails, with larger effect sizes for the MoCA. However, these estimates were not determined to be different from the OLS (SPELL OUT) estimates, so parametric regression was adequate for equating the two tests. Linear Regression produced significant effects for age and race, as well as the two splines. Education was not significant at any level. Predictions resulted in only one scientifically implausible value, and the majority of predictions were within 2 points of the true values.\n",

In addition, race and age are two previously uncontrolled for confounders that are significant.

      "Abstract Examining how factors from the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation, and Behavior (COM-B) model influence the number of households visited by frontline workers to deliver and counsel on micronutrient powders to children in Bihar, IndiaBy Tigidankay Kasanti Fadika Objective: Bihar, India has some of the highest child malnutrition rates in the world in part due to poor infant and young child (IYCF) feeding practices. Home fortification with multiple micronutrient powders (MNP) is a strategy to increase the nutrient content of a child‚Äôs food and improve nutritional outcomes. However, there is a lack of knowledge on the effectiveness of MNP programs and what factors influence FLWs to deliver these interventions effectively, especially in resource limited settings like Bihar. This study aims to examine what factors influence FLWs to deliver MNP services to children 6 to18 months in Bihar using the capability, opportunity, motivation, and behavior model as a performance guide. Methods: An endline frontline worker survey was administered to 280 FLWs in the intervention arm (MNP delivery and IYCF counseling) and 280 FLWs in the non-intervention arm (IYCF counseling only). Data analysis focused on data from the intervention arm. Descriptive analyses (mean, SD, and %) were conducted using Statistical Analysis Software (SAS) 9.4. Poisson bivariate and multivariate adjusted regression was used to model the association between FLW capability, FLW opportunity, and FLW motivation and the delivery of MNP services as measured by the number of households visited in the past month to distribute and counsel on MNPs. Results: Variables representing FLW capability, FLW opportunity, and FLW motivation were significantly associated with the number of households visited in the past month to distribute and counsel on MNPs. For FLW capability, proper MNP knowledge, receiving training on maternal and/or child health topics, and understanding the training on child feeding were all associated with an increase in the number of households visited (4%, 17%, and 26%, respectively). For FLW opportunity, receiving MNPs on a frequent basis and having a current supply of MNPs were associated with an increased number of households visited (38%, 16%) whereas slow replenishment of MNPs resulted in fewer households visited (-30%). Finally, for FLW motivation, the desire to help people or work with children, and reporting having an improved status in the community due to working in the MNP program were also associated an increase number of households visited (39% and 30%). Conclusion:  All three-behavior change inputs from the COM-B model factor into FLW performance. FLWs with higher reported capability, motivation, and opportunity had enhanced delivery of MNP services in intervention communities.     \n",

      "BackgroundHealth screening at Points of Entry (PoE) remains an integral part of stopping disease importation and exportation at borders. A large gap exists in information about health measures at PoE. There is a debate in the public health community about the effectiveness of health measures at PoE because there is limited evidence of a strong effect in decreasing transmission of infectious diseases.MethodsWe conducted a systematic literature review to determine evidence for health measures as prevention tools to highlight current practices and potential improvements at PoE. Sources from PubMed‚Ñ¢, Scopus‚Ñ¢, and the grey literature contained information from airports and ships.ResultsThe systematic literature review showed that there were limitations with health screening measures at PoE. The use of thermal body scanners, self-report questionnaires, and visual checks often misses true cases. Many believe that resources for health measures at PoE could be diverted to other preventative measures that have higher success rates.ConclusionsHealth measures at PoE work toward promoting positive health outcomes, discouraging ill citizens from traveling, improving risk awareness, educating the public, and enhancing communication between public health specialists and travel authorities. Despite concerns about efficacy, there are justifications for health measures at PoE, including health screening, temperature checks, contact tracing, vaccination, and vector control. Limitations with temperature checks, self-report questionnaires, and visual checks are evident but the way forward is clear. We made four recommendations to improve current practices at PoE: coordinate PHS; communicate between actors; consistently enforce strategies; and find equality behind enforcing health measures.  \n",

      "This thesis examines how self-identified Latinx women navigate the institution of medical authority and birth medicalization as it pertains to reproductive care, specifically childbirth, and how they tell stories and share information about their experiences via YouTube.

I examine the narratives of these women, and how they navigate authority and medicalization, through the lens of a history of colonization, a force that has widely shaped the medicalization of childbirth in the Western Hemisphere. I argue that, through their considerable command of narrative creation in the medium of YouTube, the women considered here not only create important representations for the greater Latinx community in a sphere dominated by the voices of upper-middle class white men and women, but also share valuable didactic information that has the potential to shape the way in which the people who watch their videos give birth. \n",

This paper critically examines Planned Parenthood‚Äôs history and current position within the reproductive rights world in order to understand why this organization, like all other nonprofits, is limited in its ability to catalyze significant social change. I illustrate this point by providing an overview of scholarship about nonprofits and charitable contributions, performing an analysis of Planned Parenthood‚Äôs historical eras, and analyzing Planned Parenthood‚Äôs virtual marketing materials. I argue that, despite Planned Parenthood‚Äôs remarkable success, the organization‚Äôs outsized social and political influence and dominant status as a nonprofit organization fundamentally limits the progress of reproductive rights in the twenty-first century.

      "Oral mucositis (OM) is a common, debilitating complication of conditioning regimens for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Supersaturated calcium phosphate rinse (SCPR) and palifermin have shown efficacy in preventing OM. However, whether their efficacy differs is unknown.This study compares SCPR to palifermin in HSCT patients receiving radiotherapy-based myeloablative conditioning. A comprehensive review of our institutional database was performed to identify patients who received myeloablative conditioning therapy between 2008 and 2012. The majority of patients received Fludarabine, Busulfan and total body irradiation.A total of 26 patients received SCPR and 122 patients received palifermin for OM prophylaxis. Both groups were monitored for development of OM. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was employed to estimate the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) comparing the odds of developing OM between groups and adjusting for age, gender, primary diagnosis, conditioning regimen, donor source and disease status. The odds of developing World Health Organization (WHO) grade 3 or 4 OM were significantly lower in the palifermin group (57% vs 100%, aOR=0.03, p=0.01). Moreover, the palifermin group had lower WHO grade 4 OM (22% vs 62%, aOR=0.19, p=0.0006). The overall odds of developing OM of any grade were not significantly different between the two groups (86% for palifermin group vs 100% for SCPR group, aOR=0.14, p=0.15). Subgroup analyses demonstrated the superiority of palifermin in preventing severe OM, regardless of age, sex, primary diagnosis, donor source, and disease status.In conclusion, retrospective data suggest that palifermin was more effective than SCPR in preventing severe grades of OM in HSCT patients receiving radiotherapy-based myeloablative conditioning.\n",

      "BACKGROUND:Standard cancer staging and prognosis estimates are determined at the time of the patient‚Äôs initial disease presentation. Melanoma stage III is associated with a high risk of recurrence and mortality.With the introduction of new and innovative therapies for the treatment of patients with melanoma and the recent revision of the seven editions of the AJCC staging systems; The understanding of the pattern of recurrence and the survival outcomes of these high-risk patients is important to improve early detection and management of the disease. We propose to evaluate the patterns of recurrence and the survival prognosis of patients with melanoma stage III at diagnosis.METHODS: A retrospective study of patients followed and treated at the Huntsman Cancer Institute of Utah between 2000 and 2015 was undertaken. We assessed the site and time of the first recurrence (TTR), the recurrence-free survival (RFS), the melanoma specific survival (MSS) and overall survival (OS) using Kaplan Meier survival probabilities and Cox-proportional hazard analysis.RESULTS: A total of 554 patients with melanoma stage III at diagnosis were included in the analysis. Of these, 34% were stage IIIA, 22% stage IIIB, 42% stage IIIC and 4% stage IIID. The median age at diagnosis was 55 years and the median follow- up time was 51 months. One third of this cohort relapsed with a median time to recurrence of 14 months. The main site of recurrence was nodal (34%), local or in-transit (20%), lung (20%) and brain (10%). The majority of patients who relapsed within one year after curative surgery were from stage IIIA (31%), IIIB (42%) IIIC (41%), and IIID (67%). The estimated 5-years RFS rates for stage IIIA, IIIB, IIIC and IIID were 83%, 73%, 56%, and 47%; the MSS rate were 91%, 83%, 71% and 45.5% and the OS rate were 88%, 79%, 60% and 29% respectively.The adjusted multivariable Cox regression models showed that stage IIIC (HR= 2.74, 95%CL 1.3- 5.4) and IIID (HR=3.86, 95%CL 1.4-10.5) were associated with an increase in the hazard of relapse compared to stage IIIA. Similarly, stage IIIC (HR= 3.5, 95%CL 1.9- 6.7) and IIID (HR= 9.6, 95%CL 4.0- 23.1) were associated with an increase in the hazards of death compared to stage IIIA.CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that substage IIIC and IIID at diagnosis are associated with the higher risk of relapse and death. The fact that the majority of patients relapse before 2 years urges us to concentrate follow-up surveillance within this time period.\n",

      " Background: Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) are potentially traumatic events that occur during childhood and have been shown to be associated with negative health outcomes. Most ACE studies to date have been in high-income countries with limited data on ACEs from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). No ACEs studies have been done in Honduras.  Objective: The purpose of this study is to assess the prevalence of and health consequences associated with ACEs in Honduras. This study examines the association between ACEs and health consequences to further establish if a dose-response relationship exists and if specific ACEs are more strongly predictive of individual health outcomes. Sex differences in prevalence of ACEs were also examined. Participants and Setting: The Violence Against Children and Youth Survey (VACS) was conducted in Honduras between August and September 2017. In order to assess ACEs before age 18, data is restricted to participants ages 18-24 years old, resulting in a final sample size of 1,265 males and 1,436 females. Methods: VACS is a nationally representative survey that uses a standardized methodology to measure child violence and other ACEs. This study estimated the weighted prevalence of individual ACEs (physical, emotional, and sexual violence; witnessing violence; parental migration) before age 18. Logistic regression analyses assessed the relationship between individual ACEs and cumulative ACEs and health outcomes (psychological distress; suicide ideation or self-harm; binge drinking; smoking; drug use; STIs; early pregnancy). Estimates were stratified by sex and chi-square tests examined differences by sex. Results: An estimated 77% of 18-24 year olds in Honduras experience at least one ACE and 39% experience three or more ACEs. Physical violence is prevalent in Honduras, with an estimated 30.8% experiencing physical violence and 35.4% witnessing physical violence in the community. Females experience significantly more sexual abuse (16.2% vs. 9.9%) and emotional violence (14.7% vs. 7.7%) compared to males. A dose-response relationship exists between the count of ACEs and negative health outcomes with increased odds for psychological distress (aORs: 1.8, 2.8), suicidal ideation and self-harm (aORs: 2.3, 6.4), and smoking (aORs: 1.7, 1.9) for 1-2 ACEs and 3+ ACEs compared to no ACEs. The aORs were significantly higher for 3+ ACEs compared to no ACEs for binge drinking (aOR: 1.6), drug use (aOR: 4.0), STIs (aOR: 3.9), and early pregnancy (aOR: 1.7). Physical violence vicitimization and exposure in the community were both associated with increased odds of all health outcomes. Conclusions: A majority of adolescents and young adults in Honduras are living with the consequences of ACEs. The high prevalence of ACEs and associated negative health outcomes in this population support the need for early intervention and prevention strategies in order to avoid the accumulation of traumatic experiences and disrupt the cycle of ACEs.\n",

      "In October of 2016, Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) released a public health risk assessment of Zika virus in Nigeria and interim recommendations. The recommendations stress the need for surveillance to understand and monitor the epidemiology of Zika virus in the Nigerian population with the goal of developing appropriate interventions. This study estimated the prevalence of Zika virus in North Central Nigeria using Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDTs) on stored serum samples that had tested negative for Yellow fever between 2015 and 2019. A convenience sample of 385 serum samples were tested for IgG and IgM antibodies to Zika virus. In the final sample of 280, 27 tested positive for IgG, IgM or both type antibodies (9.64%), which were specific to Zika. Higher mean annual temperature, population density and mean annual rainfall were significantly related to a higher number of observed cases. It is possible that areas experiencing Yellow fever outbreaks are likely to see cases of Zika virus due to the shared Aedes aegypti‚ÄØmosquito vector. In our study, all samples were tested because they showed typical symptoms of flavivirus type diseases, of which both Zika and Yellow fever are members of. In accordance with 80% of cases expected to be asymptomatic, as stated by WHO, it is probable that the prevalence of Zika virus in Nigeria is underestimated in our data. Persons with asymptomatic infections are less likely to observe precautions of passing the virus to sexual partners, increasing the number of babies unexpectedly born with microcephaly. In the future, outbreak response for flavivirus type diseases in Nigeria should include testing for Zika virus. Keywords: Zika virus, flavivirus, rapid diagnostic testing\n",

      "The Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) has emerged as a powerful tool to explore biology at the unitary resolution of life. It has successfully deepened our understanding of various biological problems such as cell populations, gene regulations, and cellular transcriptional states. It also opens a door for investigating complex biological systems such as brain regions and immune responses. Furthermore, it leads to the discovery of new and rare cell types, which benefits for the discovering drug targets and decoding disease etiologies in clinical studies. Even though researchers are inspired by the success of the scRNA-seq, there still exist difficulties with the respect to the data analysis. Specifically, in the scRNA-seq gene expression profiles, the sparsity of excessive zero expressions, the heterogeneity across and within cell types, and confounding batch effects together contribute to the analytical challenges. To deal with these concerns, we have developed algorithms and pipelines for different research aspects in scRNA-seq data. With the advance of high-throughput techniques, nowadays we are able to perform transcriptome sequencing for a massive number of cells experimentally. To facilitate the analysis on the large-scale scRNA-seq data, one commonly performed task is cell clustering, which enables the quantitative characterization of cell types. An essential step in scRNA-seq clustering is to select a set of most representative genes (referred to as ‚Äúfeatures‚Äù) whose expression patterns will be adopted for proper cell clustering. Currently, almost all existing scRNA-seq clustering tools include a simple unsupervised feature selection step (e.g., statistical moments of gene-wise expression distribution) and uses random top number (e.g., 1000) of features for clustering. Therefore, it is more reasonable to designate a rigorous approach for better feature selection. We created an algorithm named FEAture SelecTion (FEAST) specifically designed for selecting the most informative genes in the context of scRNA-seq clustering. We demonstrated that applying FEAST can significantly improve the cell clustering accuracy, and outperformed other feature selection methods embedded in the state-of-art scRNA-seq clustering methods such as Seurat and SC3. Furthermore, determining the sample size for adequate power to detect statistical significance is a crucial step at the design stage for high-throughput experiments. Due to the unique sparse and heterogeneous characters presented in scRNA-seq, there are few tools explicitly designed for scRNA-seq experiments to address this topic. We developed POWSC pipeline, a simulation-based approach to provide power evaluation and sample size estimation in the context of differential expression (DE) analysis. POWSC provides a variety of power evaluations including stratified and marginal power analyses for DE genes characterized by two forms (phase transition or magnitude tuning), under different comparison scenarios. Additionally, we also devised the POWCLUST workflow as an extension of POWSC with a focus on assessing power for clustering. POWCLUST is able to recover the underlining information for cell type hierarchies and cell type proportions with a proper sample size estimation. Overall, I designed new algorithms and pipelines including FEAST and POWSC for accurately selecting features and adequately evaluating power in scRNA-seq. We showcase that FEAST can assist to find more representative genes and POWSC can potentially be served as a guideline for scRNA-seq experiment design.\n",

      "Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) plays an important role in modeling the system of Left Ventricle Assist Device (LVAD), which is now a main solution for the patients who reach to an end-stage heart failure. However, because the post-surgery conditions create an abnormal hemodynamics that may eventually lead to long-term complications and diseases in aorta. CFD can be used to understand the interplay between post-op morphology, hemodynamics and clinical outcomes. However, a main fallback of using CFD is the high computational cost. In order to reach to accurate solutions with an inexpensive cost, a surrogate model for the unsteady Navier-Stokes equation is preferred. Acknowledging that heart has a periodic behavior in beats, we try to use the solution for steady Navier-Stokes equation to approximate the time-average solution for unsteady Navier-Stokes equation in periodic regime. Because of the existence of the non-linear term in the Navier-Stokes equation, this approximation will present some differences between those two solutions. By using FreeFem++ to run the numerical simulations on different geometries for those two problems, this paper will discuss how the differences between those two solutions will be affected by various of factors including the amplitude of boundary conditions, number of time steps at which the unsteady problem is solved, the quality of meshes and different geometries. From the results obtained from the numerical tests, it is concluded that the geometry will have a dominated effect on the differences between those two solutions. When the geometry is regular and indicates a non- linear term approaching to 0, the amplitude of the boundary condition will have a polynomial- like relationship with that difference. The quality of messes and number time steps will only affect the computational cost but the differences between those two solutions.\n",

      "Surfactants have duel functionalities which are able to interact with both water and oil. Designing new surfactants allows for probing the relationship between structure and function in amphiphile self-assembly. In an attempt to strive for a greater understanding of the delicate balance between hydrophobic and hydrophilic structure, this dissertation focuses on new surfactant synthesis and characterization. In Part I, a rigid hydrophobic molecule was studied and there were significant changes to the packing of the molecules in water as compared to a standard surfactant. While in Part II, a traditional long alkyl chain is used in combination with a unique diketopiperazine head group. This research has shown that alterations to the standard amphiphile structure greatly impact surfactant assembly in water.   Synthesis and Characterization of Unusal Amphiphiles Part I.

      "BACKGROUND: Postpartum depression (PPD) is the most common complication of child bearing, with nearly 12% of women in the United States experiencing symptoms, and can create two generations of suffering for mother and her child (8). Although still considered ‚Äúpostpartum‚Äù, nearly half of PPD episodes actually begin during pregnancy (13). While there is evidence supporting mental and physical health benefits of social support, it is unclear whether social support, specifically during pregnancy, is associated with PPD. \n",

      "RESULTS: In Georgia, about 8% of mothers suffer from PPD symptoms. When adjusting for maternal age, maternal race and ethnicity, maternal education, marital status, abuse before or during pregnancy, and prevalence of stressful life events (SLEs), Georgia mothers with low social support showed no difference in odds of PPD compared to mothers with high social support (aOR = 1.15; 95% CI: 0.72, 1.83). \n",
      " \n",
      "CONCLUSION: The findings of this secondary analysis did not suggest a significant association between low social support during pregnancy and PPD. Other factors beyond social support, including abuse and SLEs, may help to explain development of PPD. Although inconclusive, these findings have implications for future research on the risk factors associated with PPD.\n",

      "Background: The state of Georgia ranks poorly for a number of maternal and neonatal health outcomes in the United States. Moreover, there are significant racial and ethnic disparities in these maternal health outcomes within the state. Prenatal education has the power to improve maternal and infant outcomes. Healthy Mothers, Healthy Babies Coalition of Georgia conducted An Evaluation of Current Prenatal Education Availability and Receptivity to Online Education in the state of Georgia in 2018. This evaluation found that prenatal education curriculums in Georgia were not covering important prenatal topics in classes. Purpose: The purpose of this project was to develop, evaluate, and disseminate a prenatal education toolkit for prenatal educators throughout the state of Georgia. The topics covered in the toolkit intend to cover common gaps in prenatal education as identified by the HMHB 2018 report. The goal of this project is to inform prenatal educators on vital, yet overlooked prenatal topics, as well as guide and encourage educators in the distribution of this information to women in Georgia.  Methods: The content of this toolkit was informed by Healthy Mothers, Healthy Babies Coalition of Georgia‚Äôs 2018 report. Toolkits from other renowned organizations served as a guide for the structure of this toolkit. The toolkit underwent review by HMHB staff and by prenatal educators throughout Georgia via focus group discussions.  Results: The final toolkit can be retrieved with the following link http://hmhbga.org/wp-content/uploads/Final-Toolkit-HMHBGA-02122020.pdf. The content is published on Healthy Mothers, Healthy Babies Coalition of Georgia‚Äôs website. HMHB‚Äôs program coordinator, research & policy analyst, and I presented the toolkit at an HMHB conference and webinar. The toolkit was emailed to the HMHB listserv and prenatal educators who were contacted during focus group recruitment.  Discussion: Maternal and infant health organizations in other regions of the United States should carry out evaluations similar to that of HMHB in order to identify and act upon prenatal education gaps within their areas. Prenatal education toolkits for educators across specific regions or states can improve the knowledge base of prenatal educators, motivate educators to teach on overlooked yet important topics, and potentially improve maternal and infant health outcomes.  \n",
