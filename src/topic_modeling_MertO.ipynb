To answer this question, I will use topic modeling on the abstracts and will create a network of dissertaions (and potentially committee advisors/readers) to see how the connections in the network are reflected in the topic model. \n",

I don't think it is very novel to compare these two things and then say that they are similar, but maybe I can look at the parts where they differ and see if examining that leads to an interesting insight. I intend to generate a network of dissertaions, but right now I have a network of thesis advisors/readers in the other file."
